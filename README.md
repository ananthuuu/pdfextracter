Hi 

I have completed the given evaluation
For getting the file executed, Just start the environment by the command
*.\env\Scripts\activate*
Then you can run the file by command
*python evaltstananth.py -input sample.pdf -output sampleoutput.json*
Here the *sample.pdf* can be changed to your desired input file destination
Here the *sampleoutput.json* can be changed to your desired output file destination

I look forward to share your kind thoughts on this project

Regards 
Ananth
